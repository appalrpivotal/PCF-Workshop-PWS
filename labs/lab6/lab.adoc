This lab will require developing and compiling code.

== Requirements
You will need your favorite IDE (i.e., Spring Source Tool Suite - based on Eclipse), Java (JDK) and a build tool (Maven or Gradle).

== Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

== Getting Started - http://start.spring.io

Go to http://start.spring.io to create and download a template project.

Add a REST controller

----
$ cf push <App Name>
----

After the application deploys and starts, visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.  Currently, this data is being retrieved from an in-memory HSQL database running within the JVM.  Let's change that.
